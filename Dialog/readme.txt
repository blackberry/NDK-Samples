Basic user input - Display a dialog

========================================================================
Sample Description:

 The Dialog Sample is an application that is designed to show you how to display
 a dialog in your application. This sample uses the dialog service, which is a
 service in the BlackBerry Platform Services library. You can use the dialog
 service to create various dialogs and set the properties for these dialogs,
 such as title, message, available buttons, and so on. You can also use this
 service to retrieve information about the dialog button that a user pressed.

 When you run the application, it starts with an alert dialog already present. 
 After you have closed the alert dialog, you can later display another alert 
 dialog by swiping down from the top of the screen. An alert dialog is a simple
 dialog that contains a title, message, and buttons.
